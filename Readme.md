Here's a complete, well-structured Python Telegram bot using Pyrogram that performs real image upscaling using the Real-ESRGAN model. It processes images, sends real-time updates, and returns the final upscaled image with metadata.

‚úÖ FEATURES:
/start command.

Accepts image uploads.

Sends progress updates (uploading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí done).

Uses Real-ESRGAN for upscaling (via realesrgan).

Adds metadata: Processed by SharkToonsIndia.

‚úÖ REQUIREMENTS:
Install dependencies:

bash

Model file RealESRGAN_x4.pth must be in the script's directory. You can download it from:
https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/blob/master/weights/RealESRGAN_x4.pth

Bot supports both CPU and GPU (CUDA).

Metadata is embedded using PIL's PngInfo.
